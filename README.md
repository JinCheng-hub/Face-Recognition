# Face Recognition

This project includes three Python scripts for a machine learning vision system:

- **`capture.py`**: Captures images or video for training or testing.
- **`train.py`**: Trains a machine learning model on the collected data.
- **`detect.py`**: Uses the trained model to detect objects or recognize patterns.

These scripts work together for data collection, model training, and detection.
